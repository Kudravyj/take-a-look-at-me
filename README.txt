Hello, thats my project.
It isn't my portfolio and I made it for fun

For the first I used python, c#, arduino and some moduls that you can find in the "main" file
For correct work of the code you should to connect arduino controller or delete a couple of functions that are using
arduino. And of course you should install some library like fuzzywuzzy or numpy

Enjoy:)
